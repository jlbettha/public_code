# /from_scratch/: ml tools from scratch
# Manual implementations for fundamental ML methods and concepts.
# For personal study, review, and... let's say character-building

# Done:
- linear regression
- gradient descent
- stochastic grad descent
- k-means clustering
- gaussian mixture clustering - EM
- modules: covariance
- modules: distance metrics -> point-to-point, point-to-distr, distr-to-distr
- modules: loss function catalogue
- modules: information theory functions
- logistic regression 
- kalman -> mouse x,y follower
- unscented kalman -> mouse x,y follower
- svd 
- pca
- linear regr w/ L0, L1, and L2 (ridge) regularization
- polynomial regression w/ L0, L1, and L2 regularization
- mlp, nn - with only functions
- mlp, nn - object oriented for layer-wise constructions
- lda
- decision tree
- hierarchical clustering

# To-do:
- basic cnn (next)
